使用指令型提示词，能够快速让 AI 理解我们的需求从而解决问题。当问题的目标对象范围变宽泛，任务内容变复杂，则需要我们在提示词中增加对目标内容的描述，将复杂任务进行简化或者拆分，这样才能更高效地得到预期的结果。否则，你只能得到一个你觉得智障的回复。



## 角色扮演型（Role Prompting）

角色提示通常用于文本样式化。它涉及要求AI假装成某个人，或以某种方式行动，根据分配的角色修改其写作方式。这可以用来改变语气、风格，甚至所呈现信息的深度。

Restaurant Review: [Random Pizza Place]

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4 out of 5 stars)

As a seasoned food critic for Michelin Guide, I have the pleasure of experiencing diverse culinary creations. Today, I am thrilled to present my review of [Random Pizza Place], a delightful pizzeria hidden in the heart of the city. This unassuming eatery has its own unique charm that sets it apart from the myriad of pizza places scattered across town.

Upon entering [Random Pizza Place], one is greeted by an inviting and cozy atmosphere, exuding a comforting aura that immediately puts diners at ease. The minimalist décor with simple wooden tables and soft lighting creates an unpretentious ambiance, where the focus is undeniably on the star of the show - the pizzas.

The menu at [Random Pizza Place] showcases an impressive selection of artisanal pizzas, prepared with the utmost care and highest quality ingredients. From classic Margherita to inventive combinations, the options cater to both traditionalists and those seeking a tantalizing flavor adventure.

During my visit, I had the pleasure of trying their renowned "Quattro Stagioni" pizza, a celebration of the four seasons on a plate. Each quarter of the pizza was adorned with meticulously balanced ingredients representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The crust, hand-tossed to perfection, was a delightful blend of chewiness and crispness, providing a solid foundation for the flavor symphony on top.

The spring quarter featured a vibrant medley of fresh, locally sourced vegetables, while the summer section tantalized my taste buds with the perfect balance of tangy tomato sauce and aromatic basil. The autumn zone surprised me with earthy mushrooms, truffle oil, and a hint of nuttiness, while the winter square indulged me with velvety mozzarella, smoky bacon, and roasted garlic cloves. Each bite was a journey through the seasons, accentuating the skill and artistry of the pizzaiolos at [Random Pizza Place].

What sets this pizza joint apart from its competitors is their commitment to using high-quality ingredients. Freshly imported Italian cheeses, locally grown produce, and artisanal cured meats create a harmonious symphony of flavors that elevate each pizza to delectable heights.

The service at [Random Pizza Place] deserves a special mention. The staff is warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, readily suggesting expert wine pairings to enhance the pizza experience. Their dedication to ensuring guests feel like part of the family is unparalleled, adding to the overall positive dining experience.

The only reason I withhold that coveted fifth star is due to the limited dessert offerings. Although a fine selection of gelato is available, an expanded range of sweet treats would undoubtedly be the cherry on top of an already fantastic meal.

In conclusion, [Random Pizza Place] is an exemplary pizza destination that promises an outstanding dining adventure. With their top-quality ingredients, inventive combinations, and warm service, they undoubtedly deserve a notable place in the Michelin Guide. Whether you're a fervent pizza lover or simply seeking a remarkable culinary experience, this charming pizzeria will not disappoint.
