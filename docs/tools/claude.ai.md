Claude.ai is an AI assistant launched by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). Anthropic focuses on the safety and reliability of AI and has released two LLMs, Claude and Claude Instant. The former is Anthropic's flagship model, good at generating everything from complex dialogues and creative content to detailed instructions. The latter is a faster, more economical model suitable for casual conversations, text analysis, summaries, and document understanding. Its core product, Claude.ai, is a chatbot created based on the Claude LLM.

Claude.ai features safety, intelligent processing, and personalized customization. According to the official introduction, Claude.ai uses constitutional AI to ensure data safety and reliability. The official webpage also emphasizes data security issues. Claude.ai can handle a large amount of text data and complex instructions (100K+ tokens) and can be customized according to user needs.

Claude.ai's actual use effect is roughly on par with GPT-3.5. However, thanks to the 100K+ context limit, it can handle more content and directly upload PDF files for processing. This has certain advantages over ChatGPT. It's worth mentioning that Claude.ai is still free to use. If there are data security requirements during use or file processing scenarios, Claude.ai is a good choice.
