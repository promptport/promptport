Stable Diffusion is an advanced text-to-image diffusion model that can generate realistic images based on any text input. This tool gives users a free creative space, enabling billions of people to create stunning artworks in seconds. Users can create images using the latest released Stable Diffusion image generation model on the official page. Just enter a text prompt and click generate to get a high-quality image. Additionally, the tool emphasizes user privacy, not collecting, using, or storing any personal information, text, or images.

The dataset behind Stable Diffusion is the 2b English label subset of LAION 5b, a general crawl of the internet created by the German charity LAION.

For those who want to use Stable Diffusion in a local environment, the tool offers an option for personal private deployment. This means users can run Stable Diffusion on their servers or computers, ensuring data privacy and security. Additionally, the tool emphasizes user privacy, not collecting, using, or storing any personal information, text, or images. Moreover, Stable Diffusion is compatible with various GPUs. As long as they have 6GB or more of VRAM, most NVidia and AMD GPUs can run Stable Diffusion.
