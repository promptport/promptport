## Translation

### Daily Translation

```
I hope you can be my language assistant. Your task is to help me translate the following text into English. Please ensure the translation is concise, accurate, and in line with the usage habits of native English speakers.

Remember, your sole responsibility is to translate and provide the translated text without any additional content. Here's the text I'd like translated: "‰Ω†Â•Ω"
```

Analysis of the prompt:

1. Assigning the role of a language assistant to LLM, clearly informing LLM that the task is translation.
2. Specific requirements for translation style and content are provided. This can be modified based on the actual use case, such as increasing professionalism in wording or using different terminologies for various scenarios.
3. Emphasizing that the only task is translation, ensuring that LLM doesn't perform any additional operations on the translated content, such as explaining the content or responding to it as a prompt.
4. Providing a format for the content to be translated. When similar content is provided subsequently, LLM will recognize it based on the context and process it as content that needs translation.

## Summary

### Product Review Summary

````
Here is the product review for you to summarize:
```
Recently bought these Bluetooth headphones for my daily commute. The sound quality is crystal clear, and the noise cancellation feature is impressive. They fit comfortably over my ears, and the battery life lasts the entire day. However, considering the price, I expected a more durable build. I've seen other brands offering similar features but with a sturdier design for the same price range. The pairing process was seamless, and they connected to my phone instantly. Overall, a good purchase, but there's room for improvement in the build quality.
```

Your task is to generate a concise summary to provide insights to the pricing department. Focus on keywords like "sound quality", "battery life", "build quality", and any factors influencing its perceived value. Summarize in no more than 30 words, capturing the essence of the feedback about price and value.

Use this format: [Product Type] - [Key Feedback about Price/Value] - [Perceived Value Rating].

For instance: "Bluetooth Headphones - Good features but build could be sturdier for the price - Fair Value."

Perceived Value Ratings:
- Very Poor Value
- Poor Value
- Fair Value
- Good Value
- Excellent Value

Choose the most appropriate rating based on the review's content.

## Inference

Product Review Inference

```
In the context of product development, understanding user feedback is crucial to improve the product and meet user expectations. As a prompt engineer, your task is to analyze the product feedback and extract the following details:

- Main issue or concern raised by the user
- Suggested improvements or features
- Overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)

The feedback is delimited with triple backticks. Format your response as a JSON object with the keys "Issue", "Suggestions", and "Sentiment". If the information isn't present, use "unknown" as the value.

Output Format:
{
  "Issue": "value_here",
  "Suggestions": "value_here",
  "Sentiment": "value_here"
}

Keep your response concise and accurate.

Product Feedback:  ```{feedback_text}```
```



Analysis of the prompt:

1. Provides a background in product development, establishing the context and importance of understanding user feedback for the model.
2. The task is clearly defined, asking the model to extract key information from the feedback: the main issue, suggestions, and sentiment.
3. Feedback content is delimited using three backticks, ensuring accurate processing of input data, and a specific JSON output format is provided.
4. For uncertain or missing data, "unknown" is provided as a standard response to ensure output consistency.
5. The use of `{feedback_text}` as a placeholder enhances the universality of the prompt and the accuracy of model input.
