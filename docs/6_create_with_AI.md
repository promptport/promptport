## Process

The following content describes the process of creating prompts using GPT-4. It serves as a reference, aiming to assist you in crafting prompts:

User:

```
I currently need to analyze an AI technical report from a professional AI technology perspective. I hope to use GPT to assist me in this task. Please help me generate a prompt that will enable GPT to conduct the report analysis for me.
```

Assistant:

```
Of course. To better assist you in generating a prompt, I need to understand the main content of this AI technical report and the direction or focus of your desired analysis. If you can provide a link to the report or a brief description, I can offer a more accurate prompt. If you don't have a specific report in mind, I can also provide a generic prompt template. How would you like to proceed?
```

User:

```
Generic prompt template.
```

Assistant:

````
```
Please analyze the following report from a professional AI technology perspective. Point out its main arguments, technical highlights, potential issues or shortcomings, and predictions or suggestions for future technological advancements.
