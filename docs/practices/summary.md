## Product Review Summary

````
Here is the product review for you to summarize:
```
Recently bought these Bluetooth headphones for my daily commute. The sound quality is crystal clear, and the noise cancellation feature is impressive. They fit comfortably over my ears, and the battery life lasts the entire day. However, considering the price, I expected a more durable build. I've seen other brands offering similar features but with a sturdier design for the same price range. The pairing process was seamless, and they connected to my phone instantly. Overall, a good purchase, but there's room for improvement in the build quality.
```
